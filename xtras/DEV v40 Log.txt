|  KNOWN BUGS:  |
_________________
- GM roar sometimes crashes the map
- All NPCs require scripts so they will load a I'm not coded yet script instead
- Omok and Matchcard games give WZ error upon play
- Cash Shop sometimes pops up that the item has been added to your wishlist
- Messenger positions don't save to the database and can cause a dc upon entering
- Player Shop interactions aren't complete so you can't add items or open
